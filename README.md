### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Science Graduate student at Indiana University. I have several years of experience as a Software Engineer. My favourite thing about programming is the time spent on *debugging* things. A lot of people think that the time spent debugging something is often wasted. However, in my experience this is when you truly learn something as you observe the impact of several factors that were probably not considered while developing the program. 

Do not hesitate to offer criticism or suggestions on any of repositories. I am always ready for a good discussion.
