### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Computer Science Graduate student at Indiana University. I have several years of experience as a Software Engineer. My favorite thing about programming is the time spent debugging things. Many people think that the time spent debugging something is often wasted. However, this is when you truly learn something as you observe the impact of several factors that were probably not considered while developing the program.

Please don't hesitate to offer criticism or suggestions on any of the repositories. I am always ready for a good discussion.
